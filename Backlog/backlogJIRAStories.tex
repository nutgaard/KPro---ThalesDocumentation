		\begin{description}
			\item[Starting the app] As a user, I should be able to start the program so that i can begin browsing all features of the programm
			\item[Persisting data to phone] As a programmer I will have to implement persistence, so that the application is able to save data and retrieve it whenever it wants.
			\item[Create interface between core and gui] As a programmer, I will make interfaces that is needed so that core and gui can communicate in the simplest and best way, making it easy for GUI programmers to start using code that has not been written yet.
			\item[Sending a message] As a user, I should be able to click the "`New message"' button, so taht I am brought to the new message page, making me able to create a message and pressing "`Send"' to send it to a user
			\item[Browse previously sent messages] As a user, I want to see all messages that I have previously sent, so that I can check their status.
			\item[Browse inbox] As a user, I want to see previously received messages.
			\item[Receiving messages with attachments] As a user I should be able to receive a message with an attachment and see the attachment
			\item[Sending messages with attachments] As a user I should be able to add an attachment to the message I want to send , so that the recipient gets my attachment as well as the message.
			\item[Viewing address book] As a user I should be able to view my address book with all of my contacts, so that I am able to choose a recipient from a list when I want to send a message.
			\item[Answer, delete and forward a message] As a user I want to be able to utilize the "Answer", "Delete" and "Forward" buttons that is associated with each message so that i am brought to the correct screen for each of these operations.
			\item[Message templates] As a user, I should be able to choose a template for a message with all relevant information is predefined, as well as creating new ones, so that I can send a message without writing anything at all.
			\item[Log in to application] As a user, I should be able to log in via the loging screen so that after this process is and authorized user inside the program.
			\item[Secure communications channel] As a programmer I should implement a wrapper that makes the communication with the server secure.
			\item[Extends communication interface] As a programmer I should extend the communication implementation to support more features, so that we can have message priorities, message types, message grading, message status and notification of failed deliveries.
			\item[Implement hardware abstration layer] As a programmer I will implement the hardware abstraction layer, so that I can use the phones physical input\/output devices, as GPS, camera, video and sound. 
			\item[Distribution of addressbook] As a programmer, I should be able to distribute address books between each of the users via LDAP or Control message so that all users have an address book with all users.
			\item[Add signing to messages] As a programmer I should be able to create or use an existing library for digital signing and verification of messages.
			\item[Settings menu] As a user, I should be able to utilize the settings menu to alter different settings of the app, so that I have the settings set to what I prefer.
			\item[Compression algorithm] As a programmer I want to be able to create or find a library that minimizes data traffic that is needed to send a message so that the messages are sent faster over low speed internet connections.
