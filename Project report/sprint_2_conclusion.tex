\section{Sprint 2 - Conclusion}
The second sprint was well planned and had tasks that was doable in the given time-span we had available. We ended up with a lot more thorough documentation, especially on the parts regarding security and system architecture. We also ended up with a new demo with additional functionality of adding attributes to the messages. During this sprint there was also less time wasted on group bureaucracy since routines and group dynamics had become more integrated in the daily routines. We managed to complete all the goals we set for this sprint and can therefore conclude that the sprint was a success.
