\subsubsection{Quality requirements}

\paragraph{Usability}
\subparagraph{U1 Ease of use}\hfill
\newline
The user should be able to use the program without a lot mistakes, e.g. pressing the wrong button  because button labels are ambiguous or too small.
\newline

See table \ref{tab:easeofuse} at page \pageref{tab:easeofuse}.
\begin{table}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\setlength\hsize{.3\hsize}}X|>{\setlength\hsize{0.7\hsize}}X}
\textbf{Portion of scenario} & \textbf{Values} \\ \hline \hline
Source & End user \\ \hline
Stimulus & Use system without problems \\ \hline
Artifact & System \\ \hline
Environment & At run time \\ \hline
Response & Provide clean and easy to understand interface \\ \hline
Response measure & Only 5\% of user operations were mistakes, and not what the user wanted to do
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Ease of use} \label{tab:easeofuse}
\end{table}

\subparagraph{U2 Efficent use}\hfill
\newline
The user should be able to use the main features of the program with as few clicks as possible. Streamlined design is therefore of great importance.
\newline

\textbf{Portion of scenario} & \textbf{Values} \\ \hline \hline
Source & End user \\ \hline
Stimulus & Use system efficiently \\ \hline
Artifact & System \\ \hline
Environment & At run time \\ \hline
Response & Organize application so that important functions are easy to reach from main menu \\ \hline
Response measure & The user should never use more than 1 minute finding what he looks for
\end{tabularx}

\subsubsection{Component and Technology related constraints}
Vanilla Android is the platform of choice, compatible down to Android API 8

\paragraph{Programming language} \hfill
\newline
Developing for Android will in this project mean code will be written in Java for the Dalvik Virtual Machine. This means there is no support for multiple inheritance, and limits design choices to some degree.

\paragraph{Mobile devices} \hfill
\newline
Android is a mobile OS, so the app will run on phones, as well as tablets.

\paragraph{Input methods} \hfill
\newline
Android phones have small screens and usually no keyboard. This means the user interface must be designed to work with small touch screens as the only input method.

\paragraph{Memory}\hfill
\newline
Phones have limited memory. Typically 256-512 MB. The app will probably never be close to breaching this limit, as the most memory consuming components are a couple of textures, all smaller than 1280x800 pixels.

\paragraph{Screen resolution/aspect ratio} \hfill
\newline
As the app will support different Android devices, it also has to support different resolutions as well as aspect ratios. The graphics must be programmed to scale to different formats without degrading quality or proportions.

\paragraph{Bandwidth} \hfill
\newline
As the app probably will be downloaded from an app store over a wireless Internet connection, the package size have to be acceptable. (5-15 MB?)
\newline
Since the program is network based, it is important to pay attention to bandwidth usage. By compressing large data files before they are sent, we will reduce this to a minimum.

\paragraph{Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)} \hfill
\newline
As this project has sec
