\textbf{FR2} & \textbf{Send a message to another user:}The user has to be able send a simple message via regular email protocols to a recipient of own choice. & High \\
\textbf{FR3} & \textbf{Browse received messages:} The user has to be able to browse all messages he has received. & High \\
\textbf{FR4} & \textbf{Browse sent messages:} The user has to be able to browse all messages he has sent, and see the status of a sent message, where the relevant statuses are “message delivered” and “message read”. & High \\
\textbf{FR5} & \textbf{Viewing address book:} The user has to be able to view the address book with all contacts, so that he is able to choose a recipient from a list when he wants to send a message. & High \\
\textbf{FR6} & \textbf{Marking messages with a grade of importance:}The user has to be able to set security label, message priority and message type on a message, so that the receiver of the message knows who the message is intended for, how important it is and in what environment it is is of interest. The Message Priority will decide how intrusive XOXOmail is, that is, how much the app takes over the phone in order to show the user that a message has arrived.  & High \\

\subsubsection{Quality requirements}

\paragraph{Usability}
\subparagraph{U1 Ease of use}\hfill
\newline
The user should be able to use the program with very few mistakes, such as pressing the wrong button because button labels are ambiguous or too small.
\newline
\newline
See table \ref{tab:easeofuse} at page \pageref{tab:easeofuse}.
\begin{table}

\textbf{Portion of scenario} & \textbf{Values} \\ \hline \hline
Source & End user \\
Stimulus & Use system without problems \\
Artifact & System \\
Environment & At run time \\
Response & Provide clean and understandable interface \\
Response measure & Maximum 5\% of user operations should be mistakes (another action than the user wanted) \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Ease of use} \label{tab:easeofuse}
\end{table}

\subparagraph{U2 Efficent use}\hfill
\newline
The user should be able to use the main features of the program with as few clicks as possible. Streamlined design is therefore of great importance.

\textbf{Portion of scenario} & \textbf{Values} \\ \hline \hline
Source & End user \\
Stimulus & Use system efficiently \\
Artifact & System \\
Environment & At run time \\
Response & Organize application so that important functions are easy to reach from the main menu. \\
Response measure & A user with only a quick (5 min) training course should never spend more than one minute finding what he looks for. \\ \hline

Stimulus & Wants to open message \\
Artifact & System \\
Environment & Under normal operations \\
Response & The operation is performed \\
Response measure & With a latency of maximum 3 seconds, the user should be able to read the message after it is received. This is the latency when we subtract the download time of message, which is dependent of the network connection. \\ \hline

\subsubsection{Component and Technology related constraints}
Vanilla Android is the platform of choice, compatible down to Android API 8

\paragraph{Programming language} \hfill
\newline
Developing for Android will in this project mean that code will be written in Java for the Dalvik Virtual Machine. This means that there is no support for multiple inheritance, and this limits design choices to some degree. It prevents us from playing with some more complicated architectures and inheritance schemes.

\paragraph{Mobile devices} \hfill
\newline
Android is a mobile OS, so the program will run on cell phones and potentially tablets. 

\paragraph{Input methods} \hfill
\newline
Android phones have small screens and usually no keyboard. This means that the user interface must be designed to work with small touch screens as the only input method.

\paragraph{Memory}\hfill
\newline
Phones have limited memory, typically 256-512 MB. The program will probably never be close to breaking this limit, as the most memory consuming components are string based e-mails and potentially an attachment or two; very little of which has to remain in memory at the same time.

\paragraph{Screen resolution/aspect ratio} \hfill
\newline
As the program will support different Android devices, it also has to support different resolutions as well as aspect ratios. The GUI must be programmed to scale to different formats without degrading quality or proportions.

\paragraph{Bandwidth} \hfill
\newline
Since the program is network based, it is important to pay attention to bandwidth usage. We want to be able to wait for incoming emails and receive them as soon as the server does without having to waste bandwidth with constant polling, especially as the program is expected to see some use outside of 3G net areas.

\paragraph{Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)} \hfill
\newline
This project has security requirements that require special consideration with regards to COTS. We have to be able to trust the underlying software if it ever touches unencrypted data or has access to a memory partition (either legitimately or not) that contains unencrypted data. This means some care has to be taken in regards to what COTS solutions we can use and where we can use them.
