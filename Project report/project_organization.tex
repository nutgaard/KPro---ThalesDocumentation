\section{Project organization}
We have decided to use the Scrum model for organizing our group. This means that we have a flat organizational structure where everyone contributes with what they can. Even in a flat structure, it is important to share responsibilities, so each person of the group has a main focus area. If it is too much work for a person, it is important that the work is delegated to the others.

\subsection{Organizational diagram}
See figure \ref{fig:organizationalchart} below for an organizational diagram that shows the structure of our group internally, as well as our connection to our advisor and Thales. Notice that even though we have a Project Leader, he is at the same level as all the others. This is to indicate that the project leader is not the Big Boss . We are all equally responsible for this project being a success.

\subsection{Role allocation}
See table \ref{tab:roleallocation} below for a role allocation table that shows what roles each person have, as well as a short description of the role. The roles are merely a guideline on who are responsible for the depicted area. If the person needs more help, then we all need to contribute to get the result we want. We are all in this together.

\subsection{Weekly schedule}
See table \ref{tab:weeklyschedule} below for a weekly schedule that shows how we allocate time for the Customer Driven Project. As we all have said how much we are able to contribute to the project, we must ensure that work outside of group work-hours is done to reach the goal.
