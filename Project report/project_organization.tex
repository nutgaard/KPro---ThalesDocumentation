\subsection{Project organization}
We have decided to use the Scrum model for organizing our group. This means that we have a flat organizational structure where everyone contributes with what they can. Even in a flat structure, it is important to share responsibilities, so each person of the group has a main focus area. If it is too much work for a person, it is important that the work is delegated to the others.
