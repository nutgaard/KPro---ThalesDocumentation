\section{Project organization}
We decided to use the Scrum model for organizing our group. This means that we have a flat organizational structure where everyone contributes with what they are able to. Even in a flat structure, it is important to share responsibilities, so each person of the group got responsibility of a main focus area. If it becomes too much work for one person, we have decided that it is important that the work is delegated to the others.

\subsection{Organizational diagram}
See figure \ref{fig:organizationalchart} below for an organizational diagram that shows the internal structure of our group, as well as our connection to our advisor and Thales. Notice that even though we have a project leader, he is at the same level as all the others. This is to indicate that the project leader is not a big boss, but that we are all equally responsible for this project being a success.

\subsection{Role allocation}
See table \ref{tab:roleallocation} below for a role allocation table that shows what roles each person was assigned, as well as a short description of the role. The roles is merely a guideline on who are responsible for the depicted area. If the person would need more help, then we have all agreed to contribute to get the result we want. We are all in this together.

\subsection{Weekly schedule}
See table \ref{tab:weeklyschedule} below for a weekly schedule that shows how we have allocated time for the Customer Driven Project. As we all have said how much we are able to contribute to the project, we have agreed to ensure that work outside of group work-hours must be done to reach the goal.
