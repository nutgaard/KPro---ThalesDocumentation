\section{Project organization}
We decided to use the Scrum model for organizing our group. This ment that we had a flat organizational structure where everyone contributed with what they could. Even in a flat structure, it was important to share responsibilities, so each person of the group had a main focus area. If it was too much work for one person, it was important that the work was delegated to the others.

\subsection{Organizational diagram}
See figure \ref{fig:organizationalchart} below for an organizational diagram that shows the structure of our group internally, as well as our connection to our advisor and Thales. Notice that even though we had a project leader, he was at the same level as all the others. This was to indicate that the project leader was not the big boss . We were all equally responsible for this project being a success.

\subsection{Role allocation}
See table \ref{tab:roleallocation} below for a role allocation table that shows what roles each person had, as well as a short description of the role. The roles was merely a guideline on who were responsible for the depicted area. If the person needed more help, then we all contributed to get the result we wanted. We were all in this together.

\subsection{Weekly schedule}
See table \ref{tab:weeklyschedule} below for a weekly schedule that shows how we allocated time for the Customer Driven Project. As we all said how much we were able to contribute to the project, we must ensure that work outside of group work-hours was done to reach the goal.
