\subsection{Integrated development environment}

\subsubsection{Netbeans}
NetBeans refers to both a platform framework for Java desktop applications, and an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing with Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and others.
The NetBeans IDE is written in Java and can run on Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris and other platforms supporting a compatible JVM.

The NetBeans platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules. Applications based on the NetBeans platform (including the NetBeans IDE) can easily be extended by third party developers.

\textbf{NetBeans IDE} is an open-source integrated development environment. The NetBeans IDE supports development of all Java application types. Among other features are an Ant-based project system, Maven support, refactorings, and version control.
\textbf{Modularity:} All the functions of the IDE are provided by modules. Each module provides a well defined function, such as support for the Java language, editing, or support for the CVS versioning system, and SVN. NetBeans contains all the modules needed for Java development in a single download, allowing the user to start working immediately. Modules also allow NetBeans to be extended. New features, such as support for other programming languages, can be added by installing additional modules.
