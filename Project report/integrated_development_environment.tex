\section{Integrated development environment}

The following section shows what integrated development environment we have used.

\subsection{\gls{netb}}
\gls{netb} refers to both a platform framework for Java desktop applications, and an integrated development environment (\gls{ide}) for developing with Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and others.
The \gls{netb} \gls{ide} is written in Java and can run on Windows, \gls{osx}, Linux, Solaris and other platforms supporting a compatible \gls{jvm}. 
\newline
\newline
The \gls{netb} platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules. Applications based on the \gls{netb} platform (including the \gls{netb} \gls{ide}) can easily be extended by third party developers \cite{bib:netbeans}.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{\gls{netb} \gls{ide}} is an open-source integrated development environment. The \gls{netb} \gls{ide} supports development of all Java application types. Among other features are an \gls{ant}-based project system, \gls{maven} support, refactorings, and version control \cite{bib:ide}.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Modularity:} All the functions of the \gls{ide} are provided by modules. Each module provides a well defined function, such as support for the Java language, editing, or support for the \gls{cvs} versioning system, and \gls{svn}. \gls{netb} contains all the modules needed for Java development in a single download, allowing the user to start working immediately. Modules also allow \gls{netb} to be extended. New features, such as support for other programming languages, can be added by installing additional modules.
