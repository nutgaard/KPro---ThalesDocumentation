\chapter*{Preface}

This report was written for a project in the course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project at Norwegian University of Technology and Science (NTNU). The project was executed on behalf of Thales Norway AS between the 21th of August and the 22th of November.

The project team consisted of six students from the Department of Computer and Information Science at NTNU. Our task was to develop a mail application for handheld devices that could run at Thales' XOmail server.

The team would like thank our advisor Mohsen Anvaari for his advice and help throughout the project. We would also like to thank Reidar Conradi for his feedback.

In addition we would like to thank our customer Thales and their contact persons Christian Tellefsen and Stig Bj√∏rlykke. Their input and feedback have been invaluable and we would like to thank them for the cooperation.
