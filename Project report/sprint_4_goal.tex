\section{Sprint 4 - Goal}
The fourth sprint had a pretty clear goal: complete the project. This involved many tasks of various size and span:

\begin{itemize}
\item{}Some programming to make the application meet Thalesâ€™ requirements.
\item{}Some additional documents needed to be written.
\item{}Various small alterations through the entire report needed to be done.
\item{}Prepare for the final presentation.
\end{itemize}

Some of the tasks were pretty clear and could be done in a given time span, but mosts of the tasks were pretty unclear and could basically never be completed in the available time. The report could always be improved and same goes for the presentation. To resolve this we agreed to put in as much work as we could, and be satisfied with the result we ended up with.
