As stated in chapter 6, we tested the application continuously after implementing each functionality. However, a summary of the test results from the end of the project can be found in table \ref{tab:caseresults} on page \pageref{tab:caseresults}.

\paragraph{Discussion}\hfill
\newline
The results from the final functional testing showed that 19 out of the 28 test cases passed the test,  six failed and three almost passed. Out of the six that failed, three were due to not having time to start with the implementation and three were known bugs that we did not get the time to fix. The three that almost passed were issues that we know how to fix but had not seen until the test.

The results from the tests can be found in table \ref{tab:usabilitytestresults} on page \pageref{tab:usabilitytestresults}.

\textbf{Goal}&\textbf{Status}&\textbf{Comment}\\ \hline \hline
1&OK&-\\ \hline
2&Failed&The app crashed in the settings task on almost all tests\\ \hline
3&OK&One user sent a regular message instead of an instant message\\ \hline
4&Failed&Two users spent the same amount of time, but this could also be due to the fact that the test leaders here just counted whole minutes\\ \hline
5&OK&The average SUS score was 78.5\\ \hline

\paragraph{Summary}\hfill
\newline
			There were many problems that reoccured in the test results. Below is a short summary of what were the problems:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{}The testers were annoyed that the application does not remember login information
				\item{}Some were confused by odd choice of words
				\item{}The testers were annoyed that tilting of the phone sets you back to the inbox
				\item{}Almost all complained that the instant message and settings tab icons were not intuitive and spent some time finding the right tab.
				\item{}Some complained about small fonts and small toasts.
				\item{}Many were annoyed that the text boxes behaved weird, e.g. that the letters were not capitalized after a period and the keyboard did not always close. 
				\item{}The settings were unstable and the app stopped during the task that tested the settings.
				\item{}Many of the testers complained about the lack of confirmation after actions in the app.
				\item{}Some testers commented that the user interface was not pretty enough.
			\end{itemize}
		\paragraph{Discussion}\hfill
\newline
Even though we did not have the time to make major changes and improvements to the user interface and functionality, we learned a lot from these usability tests about how to better do things in later projects.
		
\paragraph{Redesign}\hfill
\newline
		We were able to do some minor changes in the user interface. The changes are listed below, although some of the screenshots other places may not be updated accordingly.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{}Hopefully more intuitive icon for instant message. (kanskje de to bildene her?)
			\item{}Implemented bigger difference between read and unread messages in the inbox folder.
			\item{}Text fields give you capitalized first letter of sentences.
			\item{}Rephrased some text, e.g. "username" instead of "email".
		\end{itemize}
