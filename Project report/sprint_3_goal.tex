\section{Sprint 3 - Sprint goal}
The goal of this sprint was divided into two parts. The first part consisted of being able to send a message to a testserver that Thales had arranged. We wanted to see if our messages could be processed through their internal systems and that the flags included in the header were picked up correctly. The second part was to send and receive messages with attachments. This was an important feature in the requirements specified by Thales, especially being able to send pictures and GPS coordinates as they can be a vital part of information in a military setting.

When this sprint ended we also hoped to be done with the development of the application so that we could focus on the remaining documentation that needed to be completed. As with the first and second sprint we were to show a demo of XOXOmail at the end of the sprint. This time it is most likely the final product that will be demonstrated.

To complete the goal of this sprint we sat aside many hours for implementation of new functionality. Most of the group worked full time on the application with two people working on the backend while three people worked on the various frontend issues.
