\section{Sprint 1 - Goal}
Our goal was a to have a demo ready that we could show the client, that could send and receive messages through an \gls{ssl1} channel. This would basically serve as a proof of concept; a demonstration of the technical possibilities. This would require three major components. First we would need a rudimentary user interface in order to display a received message and send a given message to an \gls{smtp} server. Secondly we would require some kind of listener that could keep in contact with the server and be informed when a new message is received, and retrieve that message from the server as soon as possible (preferably instantly). Finally we would need some kind of sender that could interface with a \gls{ssl1} protocol.
