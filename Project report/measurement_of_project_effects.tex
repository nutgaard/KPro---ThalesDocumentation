\subsection{Measurement of project effects}
The measurements of project effects state what the result of the project should be measured in. The documentation required by the Customer Driven Project itself is one project effect. An equally important effect is what we accomplish with the development of the application. Thales has stated what results they want from this project, and nothing is more important than a happy customer.

Thales proposed the following project effects:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Test a possible user interface for message-based communication on a handheld device.
\item{}Make a prototype that can give inspiration for further product development and be used as a demonstration internally and to customers.
\end{itemize}
