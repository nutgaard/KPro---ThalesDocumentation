\subsection{Measurement of project effects}
The measurements of project effects states what the result of the project should be measured in. The documentation dictated by the Customer Driven Project itself is one project effect, but what is just as important is what the customer proposes as the effects of the project. It is they who has requested work from us. Nothing is more important than a happy customer.

Thales has proposed the following project effects:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Test a possible user interface for message-based communication on a handheld device.
\item{}Make a prototype that can give inspiration for further product development and be used as a demonstration internally and to customers.
\end{itemize}
