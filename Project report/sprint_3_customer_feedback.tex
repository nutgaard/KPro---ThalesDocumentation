\section{Sprint 3 - Customer feedback}

The customer was contented with the result of sprint 3. The most important features were to send and receive messages to and from Thales' system, and the customer was very happy that this worked seamlessly. They were also satisfied with the sending of an attachment to their system.

\newline
The customer was a little disappointed with the fact that receiving a message with an attachment from Thales' server failed, and wanted this to be fixed before the end of the project. Fortunately, this turned out to be a small issue as it was just to include support for another content type of the messages. The customer also wanted us to change the mapping of the priorities to the correct abbreviations that conform to Thales' standard.

The customer representatives promised to test the app and report back about bugs, so there might be issues to come here..
