This report addresses the problem to communicate with XO-mail from a handheld device. XO-mail is a mail service that focuses on safety and on getting the mail to its destination in short time. So we are going to make an android application for cellphones and other rather small handheld devices that can provide the same safety and stability as XO-mail does on computers.The biggest issue is how to make a handheld device safe enough to send important messages.
\newline
\newline
Our motivation for working with this task is that even if there are a lot of different mail applications for handheld devices to day, none of which support the amount of security we need. So it is the part of figuring out how to get the amount of security that we need for our application that is the newest and most exciting part of this assignment. In addition none of us has ever made an android application before, so we are eager to learn how it works and how to make one. Android applications are the new hot stuff in the developing departments today, so to learn about the newest products on the market are very interesting.
