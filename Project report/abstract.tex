\textbf{This report} addresses the problem of communicating with the XOmail system from a mobile device. XOmail is a mail service that focuses on security and on getting the mail to its destination in a short time. During the project we created an Android application for cell phones and other devices that could provide the same security and stability as XOmail does on computers. The primary challenges of the project was how to make a handheld device secure enough to send important messages and to develop a user interface that was customized for small screens and easy to use.

\newline
\textbf{The motivation} for working on this task was that even if there are a lot of different email applications for handheld devices today, none of them support the amount of security we need. The newest and most exciting part of the assignment was figuring out how to implement the required level of security. In addition, none of us had done extensive work with the Android framework before, so we were eager to learn more about the technology. Android applications are the new hot stuff in the development departments today, so getting the opportunity to learn about the newest products on the market was very interesting.

\newline
\textbf{The demands} of our software project were, at first glance, quite simple. By implementing a mobile version of XOmail, the XOXOmail client, we wanted to show how a working client might look like. It is important to note that we focused on creating a proof-of-concept messaging client that used the standards given by Thales. The primary focus was not on creating a fancy user interface, but rather on fulfilling the needs of the users.

\textbf{The results} of this project was first of all a working app that consisted realizations of the better part of the functional requirements we had. Secondly the project resulted in this report, which has the purpose of documenting the problem, the process and the product.
