\textbf{This report} addresses the problem of communicating with the XOmail system from a handheld device. XOmail is a mail service that focuses on security and on getting the mail to its destination in a short time. During the project we created an Android application for cell phones and other rather small handheld devices that could provide the same security and stability as XOmail does on computers. The biggest issue of the project was how to make a handheld device secure enough to send important messages and to develop a user interface that is customized for small screens and easy to use.

\newline
\textbf{The groupâ€™s motivation} for working on this task is that even if there are a lot of different email applications for handheld devices today, none of them support the amount of security we need. The newest and most exciting part of the assignment was figuring out how to implement the required level of security. In addition, none of us have done extensive work with the Android framework before, so we are eager to learn more about the technology. Android applications are the new hot stuff in the development departments today, so getting the opportunity to learn about the newest products on the market is very interesting.

\newline
\textbf{The demands} of our software project are, at first glance, quite simple. By implementing a mobile version of XOmail, the XOXOmail client, we will show what a working client might look like. It is important to note that we will focus on creating a proof-of-concept messaging client that uses the standards given by Thales. The primary focus is not on creating a fancy user interface, but rather on fulfilling the needs the users.

\textbf{The results} of this project will be unveiled as soon as the project has ended. It is, at this time, quite difficult to say anything about the results.
