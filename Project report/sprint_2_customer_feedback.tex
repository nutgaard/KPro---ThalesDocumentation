\section{Sprint 2 - Customer feedback}
The customer was mainly satisfied with the work done in sprint 2. The most important changes had been made in the appearance of the application, and the customer approved of many of the choices made in the user interface. The customer had no comments with regards to the back-end functionality, as this part had not been significantly extended.

The customer requested certain improvements and changes in the user interface, but most of them were minor issues. Some of the points were to change the validation of fields in the \textsc{New Message}-view, reduce the size of the menu and using capital letters and non-breaking space in the security labels to conform to the SIO-label standard.
