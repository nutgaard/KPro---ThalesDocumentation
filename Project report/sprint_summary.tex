\section{Sprint summary}

This section gives a summary of what the different sprints contained and the overall goals of each sprint. 
\newline
\newline
\textbf{The first sprint} was defined to have the goal of getting a demo ready that could send and receive messages, to get familiar with the framework and investigate the possibilities of the Android framework. The application required the creation of a basic user interface and so-called back-end functionality to send and receive messages through a \gls{ssl1} channel. 
\newline
\newline
\textbf{The second sprint} was focused on the user interface of the application, that is, to make the most important screens as complete as possible at this stage. It was no focus to extend the back-end functionality, except for implementing the relevant message attributes that is specific to military messaging. The other big part of the second sprint was to dig into security issues to get an insight into what solutions exist and get an opinion of which we might implement at a later point.

\textbf{The third sprint} has the goal of connecting XOXOmail to Thalesâ€™ existing system XOmail, as we have not tried this prior to the third sprint. Another important feature is the implementation of sending and receiving messages that have attachments.

\textbf{The fourth sprint} has yet to be planned.
