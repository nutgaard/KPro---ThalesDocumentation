\subsection{Functional quality requirements}
All of the functional requirements listed in chapter \ref{ch:requirements} on page \pageref{ch:requirements}, require two things from the application and architecture, a frontend graphical user interface for the user to interact with, and backend service providing the frontend with data and functionality. The table \ref{tab:fulfillfunctionalrequirements} shows these two components for every functional requirement.
