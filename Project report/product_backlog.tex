The product backlog is an ordered list of ``requirements'' for the project. Aspects taken into consideration when ordering the backlog include business value and dependencies.\\\\
		Each entry in the backlog is on the form:\\
			\indent {Priority.}{\bf Title(Complexity in storypoints)} {Description}

			\item {\bf Compression algorithm\SP{13}} As a programmer I want to be able to create or find a library that minimizes data traffic that is needed to send a message so that the messages are sent faster over low speed internet connections (Preformance).
			\item {\bf Settings menu\SP{8}} As a user, I should be able to utilize the settings menu to alter different settings of the application, so that I have the settings set to what I prefer (FR10).
