In this chapter we have looked at what features the XOXOmail application does and does not have, as well as describing options for further development. Finally, we looked at how the requirements in the project were fulfilled by the different parts of our code.

Although we did not manage to implement all the features we planned and wanted, we are quite satisfied with the application. There are obviously ways to improve and extend the application, but we think that we have implemented many of the most important features and the customer seemed quite satisfied with the final results.
