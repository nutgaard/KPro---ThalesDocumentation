\subsection{XOmail - Secure message based information handling}

XOmail is a message system tailored for messaging within military organizations. The messaging functions within the system are suited for the needs of large
organizations with the ability to differentiate between official messages to
the entire organization and personal messages to individual users.
\newline
\newline
XOmail has the ability to send messages to predefined distribution lists where the
messages gets distributed based on a given criteria like the subject of the
message. The system also has several APIs that can be accessed by other
applications. XOmail supports message coordination for use in the drafting
process, as well as the ability to have a release authority for a drafted message.

Another characteristic of XOmail is the ability to add precedence to messages, giving high precedence messages access to resources before messages with a lower precedence. This is very important when in a military setting.
\newline
\newline
XOmail has also a high focus on security, and offers security for the messaging platform, servers
and gateways.

The system also has an extensive administration tool that can be accessed both locally and remotely.
