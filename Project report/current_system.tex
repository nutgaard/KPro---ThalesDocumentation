\subsection{XOmail - Secure message based information handling}

XOmail is a message system tailored for messaging within military organizations. The messaging functions within the system are suited for the needs of large
organizations with the ability to differentiate between official messages to
the entire organization and personal messages to an individual user.
\newline
\newline
XOmail has the ability to send messages to predefined distribution lists where the
messages gets distributed based on a given criteria like the subject of the
message. The system also has several APIs that can be accessed by other
applications. XOmail supports message coordination for use in the drafting
process, as well as the ability to have a release authority for a drafted message.
\newline
\newline 
Another characteristic of XOmail is the ability to add precedence to messages, making high precedence messages get access to resources before messages with a lower precedence. This is very usable when in a military setting.
\newline
\newline
XOmail also has a high focus on security, and offers security for messaging, servers
and gateways.
\newline

The system also has an extensive administration tool that can be accessed both locally and remotely.
