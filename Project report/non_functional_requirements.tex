Environment & At run time \\ \hline
Response & Organize application so that important functions are easy to reach from the main menu. \\ \hline

Artifact & System \\ \hline
Environment & Under normal operations \\ \hline
Response & The operation is performed \\ \hline
Response measure & With a latency of maximum 3 seconds, the user should be able to read the message after it is received. This is the latency when we subtract the download time of message, which is dependent of the network connection. \\ \hline

\subsection{Component and technology related constraints}
Vanilla Android is the platform of choice, compatible down to Android API 8

\paragraph{Programming language} \hfill
\newline
Developing for Android will in this project mean that code will be written in Java for the Dalvik Virtual Machine. This means that there is no support for multiple inheritance, and this limits design choices to some degree. It prevents us from playing with some more complicated architectures and inheritance schemes.

\paragraph{Mobile devices} \hfill
\newline
Android is a mobile OS, so the program will run on cell phones and potentially tablets. 

\paragraph{Input methods} \hfill
\newline
Android phones have small screens and usually no keyboard. This means that the user interface must be designed to work with small touch screens as the only input method.

\paragraph{Memory}\hfill
\newline
Phones have limited memory, typically 256-512 \gls{mb}. The program will probably never be close to breaking this limit, as the most memory consuming components are string based messages and potentially an attachment or two; very little of which has to remain in memory at the same time.

\paragraph{Screen resolution/aspect ratio} \hfill
\newline
As the program will support different Android devices, it also has to support different resolutions as well as aspect ratios. The \gls{gui} must be programmed to scale to different formats without degrading quality or proportions.

\paragraph{Bandwidth} \hfill
\newline
Since the program is network based, it is important to pay attention to bandwidth usage. We want to be able to wait for incoming messages and receive them as soon as the server does without having to waste bandwidth with constant polling, especially as the program is expected to see some use outside of 3G net areas.

\paragraph{Commercial off-the-shelf (\gls{cots})} \hfill
\newline
This project has security requirements that require special consideration with regards to \gls{cots}. We have to be able to trust the underlying software if it ever touches unencrypted data or has access to a memory partition (either legitimately or not) that contains unencrypted data. This means some care has to be taken in regards to what \gls{cots} solutions we can use and where we can use them.
