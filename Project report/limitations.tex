\subsection{Limitations}

\subsubsection{Technical Limitations}

\paragraph{Android}
Android is a quite new platform and none of us have been doing much programming in it before starting on this project. So learning how Android works and finding technical tools that Android supports is going to be a time consuming task. We will develop our project in Android version 2.2 with API level 8. The reason for choosing this version of Android is that we do not want to depend on features that only exist in the newer versions of Android, and 2.2 is a version that is very common.

\paragraph{Screen}
The mail client will be used on devices with relatively small touch screens which means that the application must be carefully designed to accommodate the limited size. In addition we need to put a lot of thought into the design so that it becomes easy to use. The application must be designed to scale well with different screen resolutions.

\subsubsection{Non-technical Limitations}

\paragraph{Language}
The entire project is to be delivered in English, so we all have to write in our second language. This means that the report work will take more time than writing in Norwegian. 

\paragraph{Duration}
We have a set timeframe of 13 weeks with a delivery deadline that cannot be changed. This gives us a set amount of effort and we probably do not have the time to implement all parts of the application. We have to focus on the parts we find most important. The specified timeframe gives us challenges when it comes to planning and priorities of the different tasks.
