\subsection{Limitations}

\subsubsection{Technical limitations}

\paragraph{Android}\hfill
\newline
Android is a quite new platform and none of us have been doing much programming in it before starting on this project. So the task of learning how Android works and to find technical tools that Android supports was a time consuming task. We wanted to develop our project in Android version 2.2 with \gls{api} level 8. The reason for choosing this version of Android was that we did not want to depend on features that only existed in the newer versions of Android, and 2.2 is a version that is very common.

\paragraph{Android security limitations}\hfill
\newline
There are a number of limitations that stem from our use of android as a platform. For one thing, we have a small and easy to lose device rather than a fixed installation. For another, we are relying on existing civilian network, rather than purpose built military communication channels.
\newline
\newline
A major issue for our security considerations is the mobility of our application. Our small, easily stealable device could easily fall into the wrong hands, so security has to take this into account. We do this through, as a first step, encrypting the entire phone and requiring a login on system resume, with a short timer.
\newline
\newline
An android based application is problematic in that it communicates over the internet. Thus it is conceivable that someone could listen in to our transmissions. We resolved this through the use of network layer encryption through \gls{ssl1}. 

\paragraph{Screen}\hfill
\newline
The mail client will be used on devices with relatively small touch screens which means that the application must be carefully designed to accommodate the limited size. In addition we needed to put a lot of thought into the design so that it became easy to use. The application must be designed to scale well with different screen resolutions.

\subsubsection{Non-technical limitations}

\paragraph{Language}\hfill
\newline
The entire project was to be delivered in English, so we all had to write in our second language. This ment that the report work would take more time than writing in Norwegian. 

\paragraph{Duration}\hfill
\newline
We had a set timeframe of 13 weeks with a delivery deadline that could not be changed. This gave us a set amount of effort which led to us dont having the time to implement all parts of the application. We had to focus on the parts we found most important. The specified timeframe gave us challenges when it came to planning and priorities of the different tasks.
