\section{Sprint 4 - Ordered sprint backlog}

\begin{itemize}
\item{}\textbf{Report work:} the report that is to be delivered at the end of the project needs a lot of work, and we have decided that we will use time on the report in every sprint.
\item{}\textbf{Meetings:}arranging meetings and the time we use on meetings.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}\textbf{Meetings with Thales:} We have weekly meetings with our customer so that we can get rapid feedback on what we do. To know if they agree with our decisions and that we haven't misunderstood the task thay have given us.
\item{}\textbf{Meetings with Mohnsen Anvaari:} We have regular meetings with our advisor so that he can give us feedback on how we are doing our work, and make sure that we do what are expected of us in the course.
\item{}\textbf{Internal meetings:} Every time we meet we first have a status meeting were we share what we have done and how far we have come with our tasks.
\item{}\textbf{Lectures:} there are some lectures during the semester, and we are adviced to paticipate in these. In this sprint there are 2 lectures and courses that we have decided to attend.
\end{itemize}
\item{}\textbf{Meeting and agenda document writing:} to write all the meetings agendas and minutes using the right template.
\item{}\textbf{Receiving message with attachment:} as a user I should be able to receive a message with an attachment and to see the attachment.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}\textbf{Implement:} implement showing attachments based on what was found out in the study. What this task involves, depends on which attachments we receive. A picture will be shown differently than GPS coordinates. Maybe the coordinates should be implemented into the message body, while the image will be shown by a button, as figured in the above study task.
\end{itemize}
\item{}\textbf{Instant message:} the user should be able to send an instant message using only three touches.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}\textbf{Incorporate instant message button into GUI:} get a working button in the GUI that takes the user to the instant message view.
\end{itemize}
\item{}\textbf{Delete message:} the user should be able to delete a message that is received.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}\textbf{Update GUI:} Implement the response of removing a message from the gui whenever a delete operation is completed. 
\end{itemize}
\item{}\textbf{Evaluation:} Write an evaluation of the project.
\item{}\textbf{Presentation:} Make a presentation to show for the examinator.
\end{itemize}
