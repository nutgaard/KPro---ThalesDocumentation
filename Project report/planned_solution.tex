\section{Planned solution}

The planned solution should, in a secure and reliable manner, be able to send and receive messages to and from Thales' XOmail servers from an Android phone. Naturally, this is easier to plan than to evaluate, but this section will describe how we plan to accomplish most of what Thales has requested.
\newline
\newline
When it comes to sending and receiving messages, these features are easy to test. Ensuring security is more complex. When can our application be called "secure"? When is our system "reliable"? We imagine that the best way we can proceed is to document all our choices and their implications, as well as suggestions for further improvement if the customer should want to extend our simple prototype.
\newline
\newline
In the sections above we listed a lot of functional requirements that we will try to implement in our application. Most of these were given to us directly by the customer throught the customer requirements from chapter 4.5, with a relatively short period of discussion and clarification.
\newline

The project has also stated some non-functional requirements, mostly related to usability and security. These are more difficult to quantify, and we will try to describe and justify the measures taken do ensure these qualities by extensive documentation.
