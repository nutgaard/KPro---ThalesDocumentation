\section{Planned solution}

The base evaluation of the project is: can it securely and reliably send and receive XOmail messages to Thales’ military servers from an android phone. Naturally, that is easier to state than to qualify. 
\newline
\newline
Sending and receiving is easy to test. Security is more complex. When can an application be called “secure”? When is a system “reliable”? Our best bet there is to document all our choices and their implications, as well as things that our customer could do with their additional resources if they were to extend our simple prototype. 
\newline
\newline
As such, we have listed Sending and Receiving as functional project requirements, as well as a number of other basic requirements of a messaging system. Most of these were given to us directly by the customer, with a relatively short period of discussion and clarification. 
\newline
\newline
The non-functional requirements are mostly related to usability, security, and performance. These are all difficult to quantify, and extensive documentation has gone into doing so, as will be seen throughout this document.
