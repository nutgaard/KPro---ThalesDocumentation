\section{Documentation tools}

\subsection{LaTeX}
LaTeX is a free high-quality typesetting system designed for writing technical and scientific documentation. It is most often used for medium-to-large documents, but can be used for almost any form of publishing. 
\newline
\newline
LaTeX is based on the idea that it is better to leave document design to document designers and to let authors get on with writing documents. So it encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents, but to concentrate on getting the content right.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Features of LaTeX:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Typesetting journal articles, technical reports, books, and slide presentations
\item{}Control over large documents containing sectioning, cross-references, tables and figures
\item{}Advanced typesetting of complex mathematical formulas with AMS-LaTeX
\item{}Automatic generation of bibliographies and indexes
\item{}Multilingual typesetting
\item{}Using PostScripts or Metafont fonts
\item{}Inclusion of artwork, and process or spot colour
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Google Docs}
Google Docs is a service for creating, storing and sharing files. The service is online and you can access your files from anywhere. Google Docs is free, unless you need more than 5GB of storage space. You can access your files everywhere you are; on the web, at home, at the office and on the go. It is great for sharing files with, for example, all the members of a project group. Google Docs is available for PC, Linux and Mac, Chrome OS, iPhone and iPad and other Android devices.
\newline
\newline
Google Docsâ€™s slogan is:  Keep everything. Share anything.

\subsection{Jira}
Jira is a project tracker for team planning, building and launching products. It is great for capturing and organizing issues, working through action items, and staying up-to-date with team activity. Jira is a proprietary issue tracking product commonly used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management.
