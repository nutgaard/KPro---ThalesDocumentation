\section{Sprint 4 - Customer feedback}
At the end of sprint 4 we had completed a preliminary presentation. We thought it was beneficial to perform this presentation for Thales to get some feedback on it. Thales had gathered not only the representatives from Thales for this presentation, but also a group of other employees that was interested in seeing the result of our project. The presentation went well and it was clear that the representatives from Thales was pleased with the result. A demonstration of XOXOmail connecting to Thales' systems was also performed, and was a welcoming sight to the additional employees from Thales that were present.

The overall feedback from this meeting was positive and we got a few pointers on the presentation. There were no other inquiries from Thales' representatives.
