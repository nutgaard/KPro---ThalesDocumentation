\textbf{R1. Illness / Unavailability:} A member or members of the group become ill or unavailable \\
\textbf{R2. Internal conflicts/disputes:} A conflict/dispute between 2 or more group members \\
\textbf{R3. Problems with internal or external communication:} Misunderstandings between group members or with the customer \\
\textbf{R4. Bad technical solution:} A bad technical solution/implementation is selected for the problem \\
\textbf{R5. Too much priority given to a certain task:} Too much time is spent working on a task \\
\textbf{R6. Technical incompetence:} The group does not possess the technical experience to solve a task \\
\textbf{R7. Inexperienced with software development method:} The group does not have the needed experience with the software development method \\
\textbf{R8. Hardware failure:} A hardware failure halts the projects progress \\
\textbf{R9. Chosen tools do not deliver:} Development tools cause the project to slow down \\

\textbf{Nr} & \textbf{Risk factor} & \textbf{Consequence} & \textbf{Prob} & \textbf{Strategy and actions} & \textbf{Deadline} & \textbf{Responsible}\\ \hline \hline
1 & Illness/Unavailability & \textbf{M:} Absence may halt the project progress & M & \textbf{Reduce:} Involve group members in different parts of the project to avoid complete halts for certain tasks & Continuous & Aleksander and Kristin \\ \hline
2 & Internal conflicts/disputes & \textbf{M:} Can result in problems with cooperation and thus causing the project progress to slow down & M & \textbf{Accept:} The conflict can be a constructive discusion. \textbf{Reduce:} Stop the conflict by going between the parts and try to come to a common solution fast & Continuous & Aleksander \\ \hline
3 & Problems with internal or external communication & \textbf{M:} Group members can end up doing things the wrong way or the group misunderstands the customer's wishes & M & \textbf{Avoid:} Have frequent internal and external meetings to discuss what has been done and what needs to be done. \textbf{Accept:} If something is done the wrong way we have to do it again & Continuous & Everyone \\ \hline
4 & Bad technical solution & \textbf{H:} The project will not be completed before deadline or it will not be completed & M & \textbf{Avoid:} Plan well and conduct a thorough pre-study & Sprint 1 & Nicklas \\ \hline
5 & Too much priority given to a certain task & \textbf{M:} May affect the quality of other important tasks & M & \textbf{Avoid:} Plan the time distribution carefully \textbf{Reduce:} If we find that a task is given to much priority, let everybody on the team know about your concern, and then change the priority & Continuous & Lars \\ \hline
6 & Technical encompetence & \textbf{H:} The group will b unable to finish the project & H & \textbf{Avoid:} Choose familiar solutions for the problems that occur and do a thorough investigation into unfamiliar technologies that are to be used \textbf{Transfer:} If one or more of the members get's a problem they can't solve, ask someone else & Continuous & Everyone \\ \hline
7 & Inexperienced with software development method & \textbf{M:} Lack of documentation and too much time spent on administration & M & \textbf{Reduce:} get familiar with the software development method early and be thorough with the documentation & Continuous & Aleksander \\ \hline
8 & Hardware failure & \textbf{M:} may cause unexpected delays & M & \textbf{Avoid:} have decent version control and make information available from different locations & Continuous & Everyone \\ \hline
9 & Chosen tools do not deliver & \textbf{M:} may halt the project progress & M & \textbf{Reduce:} find out what the most suited tools on the market is and get familiar with them & Preliminary study & Nicklas
