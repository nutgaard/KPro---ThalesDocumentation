\subsection{Templates and standards}
The group has decided to make templates and standards for the most relevant document types. Even though it will take some time to create these in the beginning, we believe it will benefit us over time.

\subsubsection{Templates}
We have made templates for agendas and minutes of meetings, as well as for the weekly documents. These are located in Appendix ???. The template make the work for our agenda and minutes responsible a lot easier.

\subsubsection{Standards}

\paragraph{Organizing files}
\subparagraph{Google docs}\hfill
\newline
We use Google Docs to organize our files so that our entire team can look at and change all the documents we have whenever they want. We have one folder that contains our entire project and in that folder we have subfolders to make the best overview possible. We try not to have too many files in each folder so that finding a specific document becomes as easy as possible.

\subparagraph{Git}\hfill 
\newline
We also use git so that it is easy to share all the code and documents as well. When using \gls{git} all the team members have access to change, read and use all the code files whenever they feel like it.

\subparagraph{Saving files on gitHub}\hfill
\newline
All documents and Java files must compile before they are pushed to the repository.

\paragraph{Naming of files}\hfill
\newline
All the files in our project have a name that starts with the date they were created so that theyâ€™ll be easier to find. The name also contains one or two words that explain what the documents consists.

\subparagraph{Agendas}\hfill

"YYYY-MM-DD - Agenda - [Customer/Advisor/Internal]"

\newline
"YYYY-MM-DD - Minutes of Meeting - [Customer/Advisor/Internal]"
