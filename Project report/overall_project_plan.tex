This chapter is about how we planned our project. The purpose of this chapter is to explain how our team is organized, who we are, why we do this project and how do it.

\section{Overall project plan}

\subsection{Project name}
XOXOmail

\subsection{Project sponsor}

The customer for this project is Thales Norway AS. Thales is a leading international electronics and systems group, focusing on defense, aerospace and security markets worldwide. The cutting edge technology in use at Thales offers capabilities unmatched in Europe for the development and deployment of mission-critical information systems proven in the field. The group’s civil and military business areas develop in parallel and share a common base of technologies to serve a single objective: the security of people, property and nations.

\subsection{Background for the project}

This project was given to us as an assignment in the course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project. Since the society is constantly changing, the technology must follow along with the enormous changes we see today. Because of these changes Thales found that they needed a handheld android version of their existing XOmail system. This new handheld system would help the users of XOmail so that they could also use it in the field and not only at the office. When able to use this mailing system not only in contact with a computer, the regular working day of Thales customers would be a lot easier, especially since their primary customer is the Norwegian military.



\subsection{Duration}
The course staff has suggested a estimated 25 hour week for each student. This will give us a total of 1950 working hours since we are 6 students in our team and the project is distributed over 13 weeks.
