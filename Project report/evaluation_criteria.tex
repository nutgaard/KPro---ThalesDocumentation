\section{Evaluation and conclusion of project study}
We have now seen what the wanted functionality is of the app we were requested to make was. It is in many ways a regular mail client, but with additional specific functionality related to military attributes, priorities and of course security. A study on similar solutions has been made. This is an app with a very specific target group, so we did relatively fast realize that we would not find an existing app that solves this problem. What we did find out was that there exists a lot of other mail clients as well as apps and libraries that support signing and verification, but not the full package.  Some of the ideas regarding design and solution can be used in our app, but not directly.
\newline\newline
This has been a project with a lot of uncertainties, and choosing development model has been important for us. The choice fell on agile development in form of Scrum. It fits this kind of project where uncertainty and regular revisions is a central part ov development. Using a waterfall model would be too rigid for a project like this.
\newline\newline
One of the most important decisions we did in the start was to decide on what tools we wanted to use during the development process and what programming language(s) we should use. The first and obvious choice was Java, as this is the de facto standard for Android programming. Even though we did a investigation to see if other programming languages could do the work better for us in certain settings. This was not the case. All other languages would give us more problems than advantages, so the choice fell on Java. Then we had to do a choice on what development environment we should use. This was in many ways an unfortunate choice regarding Android development, but nonetheless it was made. In the long run this was not a problem, but we certainly missed having some tools in Netbeans. We now had to decide the important things for the app.
\newline\newline
The first choice that had to be done regarding the app was if we were to have the service part of the app locally or on a server. Since Android supports local service easily, this was the choice we fell on.
\newline\newline
One of the most important aspects of the app was to find out what security features that are facilitated by Android and what needed to be implemented by us. In order to do this we had to make assumptions about the phone, the users of the app and the network. When this was done we could discuss what is secure and what is not under these assumptions. We then ended up with different solutions on how a secure communication channel could be made and that local storage of the current user is sufficient under the assumption that no one will get unwanted access to the phone. We also assume that the user will be able to log in to the app every time it starts without any problems.
\newline\newline
Since this is an app that does encryption before sending messages, we wanted to check that the app performs well under conditions where the network connection is limited. We saw that it worked without any problems.\newline\newlineWhen it comes to compression, we saw that this was a complicated field of study. What we ended up with was a listing of a lot of the most current techniques that is a possible. Deciding on a compression teqhnique for the different data types is beyond the scope of this project.
\newline\newline
At the end we listed up all relevant licences for tools and software that we have done, and ended it with a summary of the different licences. s
