\subsection{Design guidelines}

\subsubsection{External resources}
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Create all strings in res/values/strings.xml for easy access and modifiability
\item{}Create all colors in res/values/colors.xml 
\item{}Use the same style for similar components throughout the application, and preferrably create styles in the res/values folder
\item{}Provide assets for all, e.g. images for low, medium and high screen densities
\item{}Consider using separate XML files for portrait and landscape mode to optimize for both views
\item{}Font sizes: Use 12 sp (scale independent pixels) for micro sized text, 14 sp for small, 18 sp for medium and 22 sp for large. 
\item{}Be careful with the use of colors
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{General from Android}
\begin{itemize}
\item{}If it looks the same, it should act the same
\item{}Only interrupt the user if it is important
\item{}Keep texts brief 
\item{}Try to use pictures instead of long texts
\item{}Make important things fast
\item{}Be gentle if the user does something wrong and give clear recovery instructions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pure Android} 
\begin{itemize}
\item{}Do not mimic UI elements from other platforms
\item{}Do not carry over platform-specific icons
\item{}Do not use bottom tab bars
\item{}Do not hardcode links to other apps
\item{}Do not use labeled “Back” buttons on actions bars
\item{}Do not use right-pointing cares on line items 
\end{itemize}
