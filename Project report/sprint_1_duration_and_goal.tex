\section{Sprint 1 - Duration}
The first scrum sprint officially began with a planning session August 27th and ended 22 days later on the September 17th. We choose to divide our time into four three week sprints, as this allowed us to divide up the 13 week project simply and evenly, with 1 week to plan and organize in the beginning.

\section{Sprint 1 - Goal}
Our goal was a to have a demo ready that we could show the client, that could send and receive messages through an SSL channel. This would basically serve as a proof of concept; a demonstration of the technical possibilities. This would require three major components. First we would need a rudimentary user interface in order to display a received message and send a given message to an SMTP server. Secondly we would require some kind of listener that could keep in contact with the server and be informed when a new message is received, and retrieve that message from the server as soon as possible (preferably instantly). Finally we would need some kind of sender that could interface with a SSL protocol.
