\subsection{Programming languages conclusion}

As we can see, there are many ways to create software for Anroid. One can rely on only one language for programming, or using a combination of languages. We have chosen to develop purely on a Java platform. Why is this relevant for us, as we are creating an Android application?
\newline
\newline
First, it is the most used developing language for Android, which means we are using a well tested and documented development framework. It is unlikely that we will run into big problems. Second, we are all familiar with using Java, so the learning curve will only be a bit steep for those in the group that are new on Android development.  Another benefit of using Java, is that if we decide on implementing a server part, we can create the server first, and then decide if we want it to run on the phone or directly on for example a computer, that be Linux or Windows computer or something else. This flexibility is something we only can get from Java.

\newline
We chose Java as our main programming language, as this the most widespread language and has most support online. It is the language which has been pushed forward the most from Google. It is the recommended language to write Android apps.
