\section{Sprint 1 - Duration}
The first scrum sprint officially began with a planning session August 27th and ended 22 days later on the September 17th. We choose to divide our time into four three week sprints, as this allowed us to divide up the 13 week project simply and evenly, with 1 week to plan and organize in the beginning.
