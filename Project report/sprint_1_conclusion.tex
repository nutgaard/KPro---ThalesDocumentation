\section{Sprint 1 - Conclusion}

Despite a number of setbacks, some late planning and technical problems, the first sprint was a success. We managed to create a working prototype, as well as a number of (as of yet) unconnected components. We hammered out a functional architecture, which should be more than robust enough to handle any changes forced on it in the next sprint. And we are well on schedule when it comes to the documentation; including a number of templates and designs for the type of files we produce a lot of (agendas and minutes especially).

In the sprint 2 we want to better at planning and more structured in our work. We want to create more concrete tasks for people to work on instead of big ones that no one knows what are really about, that is, conform better to the Scrum process. We also hope that the tools will give us less problems and more time to focus on the real work. We have also realized that we need to utilize every hour of the sprint and work hard continuously.
