\section{Sprint 1 - Conclusion}

Despite a number of setbacks, some late planning and technical problems, the first sprint was a success. We managed to create a working prototype, as well as a number of (as of yet) unconnected components. We hammered out a functional architecture, which should be more than robust enough to handle any changes forced on it in the next sprint. And we are well on schedule when it comes to the documentation; including a number of templates and designs for the type of files we produce a lot of (agendas and minutes especially).
