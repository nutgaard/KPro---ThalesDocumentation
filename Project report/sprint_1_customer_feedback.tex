\section{Sprint 1 - Customer feedback}

Thales was largely positive about our progress in Sprint 1. They were extremely pleased that we had managed to build a working prototype. They noted that we had gotten far in already being able to send and receive messages, and that boded well for our ability to implement some “interesting” components later in the process.

There was, however, a number of points they felt needed work. They had a number of comments on the \gls{gui}; both the rudimentary version used in the demo and the mock up “paper” prototype that we had sent them earlier. They wanted label (drill, exercise, etc) and the sent time/date included in the inbox display of emails, as well as security clearance. They also wanted security clearance visible in the top right corner whenever classified information was visible on the page.

They also had a number of comments about our project planning and use of scrum. Most importantly, we had fallen into the practice of using too general posts, leading ambiguities about what parts of that post was included in the current Sprint and what was to be implemented later. We agreed to avoid this in the future, and resolved to include this in our discussions of Sprint 2. There was also some minor comments on various sub-tasks and small ambiguities to clear up, but nothing major.
