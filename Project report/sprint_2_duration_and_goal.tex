\section{Sprint 2 - Sprint duration}
The second sprint started with a planning session on September 18th and ended at October 7th. 

\section{Sprint 2 - Sprint goal}
The goal of the second sprint was to increase the depth of the documentation, especially the architecture documentation, and get further insight into the security issues that arise with several parts of the application.

\newline
At the end of the sprint we were also going to show a demo to the Thales that would have the functionality of adding attributes to messages.

In order to achieve this sprintâ€™s goal, we needed one group member to document our architecture properly, two group members to continue the work with the application, while the rest of the group members looked into the security problems we were facing, and how we best could solve them.
