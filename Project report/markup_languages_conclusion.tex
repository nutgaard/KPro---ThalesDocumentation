\subsection{Markup language conclusion}
XML is a widespread exchange format which has a lot of libraries that can be used to generate XML data. Even though, it is known that XML is primarily a document exchange format, where as JSON is better suited for data exchange. This means that JSON often is much more readable, as the mapping between objects in programming and JSON representation is much more alike. As a result, the JSON code is easier for machines to read and write. JSON is becoming more and more common, and is now widely adopted by the computer industry.
