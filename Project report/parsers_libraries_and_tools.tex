\subsection{\gls{xs}}
\gls{xs} is a simple Java library to serialize objects to \gls{xml} and back. Using \gls{xs}, you can serialize most Java objects without any mapping. Object names become element names in the \gls{xml} produced, and the strings within classes form the element content of the \gls{xml}.

The classes that you serialize with \gls{xs} don't need to implement the Serializable interface, thanks to \gls{xs} handling all serializations. \gls{xs} is a serialization tool and not a data binding tool, which means that it doesn't perform class generation from an XML Schema Definition (\gls{xsd}) file \cite{bib:xstream} \cite{bib:ibm}.

Another feature of XStream is that it has the capability to serialize to and from \gls{json} as well.
