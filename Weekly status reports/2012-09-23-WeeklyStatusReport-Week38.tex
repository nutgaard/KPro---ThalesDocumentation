\section{Challenges ahead}
The challenge is to balance the work load between the report and the implementation and security studies that the customer is
mostly interested in.
\section{Status summary}
The customer was satisfied with the result from the previous sprint.
The focus of the next sprint is the user interface and studies of security issues, 
and the group have started working on these tasks.

\newline
With regard to the project report, we have almost completed the chapters for planning and sprint 1. The pre-studies and analysis
chapter is still under progress, as we have not planned to implement security features until the next sprint.
